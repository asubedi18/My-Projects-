This week, I used AI while working on the exercise to explain a few concepts that I didn't know, such as f-strings and boolean expressions. I didn't use AI to complete any exercise; instead, 
I asked the TA to help with a few that I didn't understand. Here is my chat with AI  https://chatgpt.com/c/68c99ee6-11ac-8328-9569-322d9468e0cc

My project team also uses ChatGPT for ideas. For instance, we had a bunch of ideas, but couldn't settle in one of them so we 
Give him our prompt and ask for pros and cons of each, then we pick out the best one. here is the chatgpt

I also tried another website, Preprity AI, which had a similar function but worked differently.
It provided a lot of feedback, but nothing very useful. 
For instance, ChatGPT sometimes uses Google-like answers, which were often incorrect, 
while Preprity AI gave more accurate answers but didn’t sound human at all.

When I compared both AIs using the same prompt, they gave very different results,
which shows their functions are quite different.
At the beginning, their responses were similar, 
but toward the middle, the output from one of them stopped making sense. 
It gave answers based on outdated statistics and information that was no longer true.
